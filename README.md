# VCamera

A fake camera that allows you to choose a picture

## How to use
When other applications call the system camera to take photos, you can use this camera to select pictures directly from the album.

This app simulates the camera app and does not have hook camera data, so it cannot replace the internal camera of the app, such as WeChat.

## Applicable scene: 
1. Other applications only provide photos (system camera) and do not provide a selection of pictures; 
2. When the camera is broken and other applications need to provide pictures; 
3. When the simulator does not provide the camera function; 
4. etc.
